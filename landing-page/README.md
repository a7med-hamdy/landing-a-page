# Landing Page Project

once the page is loaded you can access the navigation menu by hovering over it using pc or clicking on it if you are using a phone.

the viewed section is highlighted both in the page and in the navigation menu.

the navigation menu disappears if the user is not scrolling, and appears again if he/she starts scrolling.
